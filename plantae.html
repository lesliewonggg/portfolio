                          <p>Our team brainstormed together on who would be a potential user for our plant care application. This was the <b>Proto Persona</b> (pictured to the right above). 
                            We came together and reflected upon our own plant parent misgivings and issues and ultimately came up with a user who wants to successfully grow more
                            plants but also has a busy schedule to keep in mind. 
    
                              <br><br>
                              My team and I proceeded to go down the list of items that we needed to check off our to-do list and created an online checklist so that we all 
                              could keep track of which person was at which stage of their divied up tasks.
                              
                              <br><br>
                              Our <b>Research Plan</b> was formed after we discussed at length about which features we wante to focus on, our target audience, and the general need for such an application to
                              improve the user experience. We proceeded to create an <b>Interview Plan</b> detailing what questions we would ask during interviews and discussed together at length about 
                              which questions might provide us with the best insight and information gathering.
                              </p>
                              <br>
                          
                              <p><b>My teammate, Marissa, conducted 5 user interviews with 15 questions prepared.</b>
                              They ranged from questions pertaining to their interest in plants, their general plant care experience, and how they determine if they are going 
                              to look at plants in general. We also wrote out the interview transcripts and recorded all the interviews so that we could look back on their answers 
                              later on so that we didn't mishear anything.
                                  </p>

                          <p>After interviews were finished, I started creating an <b>Affinity Diagram</b> (pictured above). I took the interview answers,
                              typed them onto sticky notes on a Miro board, and grouped them together based on the categories or similarities of the sticky notes' contents.
                          <br><br>
                          This information was when used to create an updated <b>User Persona</b> (pictured below) 
                          based off actual data and not our original assumptions of a target user of this application.</p>

                              <br><br>
                              Surprisingly, 43.5% of participants (10 out of 23 people) said they owned more than 7 plants which surprised our team. We had 
                              assumed that most participants would range between 1 to 3 but to see that owning plants was such a common practice was also reassuring for creating our mobile application.

                                  This summarized the problem statement along with data gathered through interviews.
                                  <br><br>

                              <p>We created a <b>Competitor Analysis</b> (pictured above to the right) and together we looked up various other plant care applications and 
                                weighed out the pros and cons of each one. One major factor in our deecision-making was that key features 
                                were considered "premium" and required payment on these applications. A lot of them offered watering reminders for free but 
                                other information was paywalled. 
                              <br><br>
                      Next, I developed a <b>User Flow</b> (pictured below) based on the features we picked. I learned a lot about creating user flows when creating this one compared to my first solo application case study. 
                      I went back and forth with asking my teammates for their thoughts about the potential user flow.

                                  <p>Based on my user flow, we all went on to do some <b>Sketches</b> (pictured above). This is where our differences as a team came out the most. We all 
                                realized at the same time that we had different visions about how things would look on our mobile app beyond the onboarding screens. 
                            Some of us wanted to have plants displayed on the front home page, some of us didn't see the need to include all that information 
                        on the home page, some of us preferred tabs over buttons, etc. This was the most time-consuming part of our collaboration: sketching and low-fidelity designing. 
                    We were all trying to consolidate our ideas to create a singular product.<br><br>

                                      <br>After figuring out the general idea of the designs we were going for, we designed our <b>Low-Fidelity Prototype</b> 
                                      (pictured above) using Whimsical. We were all in a Zoom call together as we talked about how to consolidate all of our ideas 
                                      into one vision. After we designed these, we moved onto doing testing.

                                Testing is an important way for designers to have unbiased users look over 
                                a product or idea and give their honest feedback. Sometimes working on something 
                                for a long period of time will skew one's opinion so it is always important 
                                to get feedback for usability or confusing wording.

                                  <p>After finishing designing our low-fidelity prototype, we moved onto the testing phase.
                                      We performed <b>Usability Testing</b> on 5 participants. 
                                      The tests were done over Zoom. The testers remote controled the Figma screen to go through the tasks 
                                      on our prototype.
                                  <br><br></p>

                                  <b>Tasks:</b>
                                  <ul>
                                      <li>Sign up for an account on Plantae.</li>
                                      <li>Complete the survey to find plant recommendations.</li>
                                      <li>Add a plant from the survey results to your wishlist.</li>
                                      <li>Add a plant to your plant list via the camera.</li>
                                      <li>Create a community post.</li>

                                  <p>Through our testing, we found out that we needed to simplify the plant information on the plant overview pages, 
                                      specifically on our plant survey result page. We had overloaded it with too much information 
                                      and made the choosing process clunky. We also needed to reword a lot of parts for clarity and be mindful 
                                      of the icons we chose for certain parts of our app as to not confuse people.

                                  <p>After usability testing, I went back to my old user flow and iterated on it based on my added actions and feedback. 
                                      The <b>Iterated User Flow</b> (pictured above) improved my understanding of the processes and was discussed at length with my team.
                                  <br><br>
                                  Finally, it was time to add color, utilize feedback, and apply our knowledge to the <b>Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</b> 
                                  (pictured below). I took into account our bright but muted green focal color and applied that around the mid-fidelity prototype. 
                                  We made all the buttons the same rounded design, added color for "cancel" and "stop" related buttons as red, and also added pictures and iOS design principles 
                                  to our final product.

                                              This was our first group project together so it was a learning process to remember to
                                             talk to our teammates as we went through design ideas. We couldn't just apply a color or design without 
                                            first consulting with another team member. We also didn't want to step on each other's toes or nag another 
                                        about their work so creating a task list on Trello really helped to see who was doing what work.</div>
                                          <div class="col-sm-4"><b>Lots of iteration:</b><br><br>
                                              I realized that iterating on a design was important after iterating on the user flow for the 5th time in a row. I put 
                                            a lot of thought into how the user would navigate the process on the application. This only increased after 
                                        designing how the plant care application would look like in terms of onboarding to identifying a plant to adding one. We went through 
                                    at least 3-4 different designs.</div>
                                          <div class="col-sm-4"><b>For the future?</b><br><br>
                                              We would definitely add more color into the application aside from just greens and also enhance the 
                                            community feature, including the ability to add topic tags to post, filter for topics, and follow topics and users. We also 
                                        want to add an ability to directly connect with plant doctors or specialists as a premium feature. A more easily accessible 
                                    feature to add would be a "plant shop map" that would give you a list of plant shops near you.</div>
