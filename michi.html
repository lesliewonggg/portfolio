                <h1><b>MICHI, a travel planning mobile app.</b></h1>
                <p>For my first UX Design Bootcamp assignment, we were tasked with creating a mobile application for travel planning. I originally decided to create an app focused on seeking out local recommendations but found the niche aspect to
                    be difficult. I changed my entire research plan and pivoted towards the type of traveler I am: super planned with almost every second accounted for.</p>

    <div class="clear"><br>
    <p>First, I started off by creating an idea of what I thought the target audience might be for a specialized travel planning application.
        This was the <b>Proto Persona</b> (pictured to the right above). I based her behaviors around being a neat, organized individual who enjoyed traveling. 
        <br><br>
        Next, I began constructing the <b>Research Plan</b> of what I believed my app would entail, goals I had, potential research methods
        like interviews and surveys, and created an <b>Interview Plan</b> detailing what questions I would ask during interviews.
        These interviews would help answer my research questions.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="quote"><img src="images/michi/interviewguylaine.png"><i>"I like knowing what I’m doing or having an idea of <br>
            where I’m going so things don’t get overwhelming.”</i>
            <br><br>
            -Guylaine O.</div>
        <br><br>
        <p><b>I conducted 6 user interviews with 15 questions prepared.</b>
        They ranged from those who travel frequently to those who only traveled once in a while. As a result, the data I gathered was quite varied across the board. 
            </p>
    <br>
    <div class="pix"><a href="images/michi/affinity1.png" target="blank"><img src="images/michi/affinity1.png" width="400px"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="images/michi/affinity2.png" target="blank"><img src="images/michi/affinity2.png" width="474px"></a></div>
    <br><br>
    <p>After interviews were finished, I started creating an <b>Affinity Diagram</b> (pictured above). I took the interview answers,
        typed them onto sticky notes on a Miro board, and grouped them together based on the categories or similarities of the sticky notes' contents.
    <br><br>
    This information was when used to create an updated <b>User Persona</b> (pictured below) 
    based off actual data and not my original assumptions of a target user of this application.</p>
    
    </div>

    <div class="casestudy3"><a href="images/michi/userpersona.png" target="blank"><img src="images/michi/userpersona.png" width="570px"></a></div>
    <div class="intro2"><p>Going off the type of interview questions I used,
        I went on to gather additional data by <b>creating a survey</b> on Google Forms to hand out.
        <br><br>
        Participants were split and enjoyed a certain level of planning but were generally open to spontaneity. 
        It was interesting to see the different, split perspectives.
        
    <br><br>
    <a href="images/michi/survey.png" target="blank"><img src="images/michi/survey.png" width="300px"></a></div>

    <div class="clear"><br></div>
    <div class="intro3"><p>Lastly, I took the data from the affinity diagram and user persona I created to
        draw up an <b>Empathy Map</b> (pictured to the right) to show how a potential user might be feeling stress about the travel planning process. 
        I thought about possible problems that might arise throughout the planning process.
        <br><br>
        After finishing up my initial data gathering for user research, I then moved onto the
        Definition & Ideation phase to flesh out my design idea.<br><br>

    <div class="casestudy5">
        <p>Next up was identifying what potential problems or issues that 
        travelers might have with their travel planning process. I developed the following <b>Problem Statement</b>:
        <br><br>
        <ul><li><i>“Meticulous travelers want to visit a variety of locations while 
        they’re on a trip but don’t want to spend too much or little time at each one. 
        They need a way making travel plans to calculate how much they can fit in their itinerary.”</i></li></ul></p></div>    

    <div class="clear"><br>
        <p>After figuring out the “problems” that meticulous travelers might face, I went on to creating a <b>User Insight Statement</b>. 
            This summarized the problem statement along with data gathered through interviews.
            <br><br>
            <ul><li><i>“Meticulous travelers have difficulty planning itineraries because they want to visit 
            so many different places. During the surveys, we found that many preferred to plan ahead of 
            their travels and half would also calculate how much time they spent at a location before they went.
            <br><br>
            Therefore, we believe that they want to keep track of their time and that we might be 
            able to help if we provide assistance in the planning process. We might do this by creating a 
            planning application focused on budgeting their time and expenses for each location on their schedule.”</i></li></ul>
            <br>
    <div class="alignleft"><a href="images/michi/valueproposition.png" target="blank"><img src="images/michi/valueproposition.png" width="300px"></a><p>I thought about my brand’s “identity” and thought of a simple phrase that described the app for my <b>Value Proposition Statement</b> (pictured above to the left).</p></div>
    <br>
    <div class="alignright"><p>I used the I Like, I Wish, and What? process to think through potential features that travelers would enjoy using on my mobile app.
        <br><br>
        I Like was for doable ideas, I Wish for future ideas, and What If? for outrageous but fun ideas. This was my overall <b>Brainstorming</b> process (pictured on the right).</p> <a href="images/michi/brainstorm.jpg" target="blank"><img src="images/michi/brainstorm.jpg" width="400px"></a></div>
        <br>
    <div class="alignleft"><a href="images/michi/featurematrix.jpg" target="blank"><img src="images/michi/featurematrix.jpg" width="300px"></a><p>I narrowed down my list of ideas from the brainstorming session and used to Now Wow! How? method to create a 
        <b>Feature Prioritization Matrix</b> in Miro. I thought about what features I definitely needed (time management) and what might not be so important at the moment (calculating expenses over a period of time or needing separate categories).</p></div>
        <br>
    <div class="casestudy6"><p>I followed up and created a <b>User Scenario</b> (pictured to the right) based on my interview data, user persona, and user insight statement. I made sure to include as much detail as I could 
        so that I could get a good feel for a traveler’s thought process as they plan.
    <br><br>
    Next, I created a <b>Storyboard</b> (pictured below) based off what I wrote in my User Scenario. I used free-for-use vectors from Freepik. I utilized a variety of pictures to show how much time that Charlene, 
    my traveler user, was saving by having her entire schedule planned out with times and expenses accounted for.</p></div>

<br></div></div><br>
<div class="intro3"><p>Lastly, I created a <b>User Journey Map</b> to depict Charlene’s emotional state and thought process as 
    she goes through her time finding and using the mobile app. It won’t solve all her “problems” but it will improve them. 
    <br><br>
    The journey map allows me to empathize further with how she might be feeling or gives me an idea of 
    potential things to add or take away from the design process. Next, I went onto sketching and prototyping.<br><br>

        <p>I conducted a <b>Competitor Analysis</b> (pictured above to the right) and looked up other travel planning apps 
        specifically made for planning out schedules. Some apps developed their own itinerary for you and others also 
        included GPS recommendations based on your location. None of them really gave a “___ much time left in the day” option so 
        I knew that was something I could advertise in my mobile app.
        <br><br>
Next, I developed a <b>User Flow</b> (pictured below) for how the sign up/log in process would go. I also added in how things would play out if travelers added locations, times, and potential expenses.

            <div class="clear"><br><br>
            <p>Based on my user flow, I went on to do some <b>Sketches</b> (pictured on the left above) on how I thought onboarding screens 
                along with basic action screens might look like. I also got a good idea of how the general placement for buttons and 
                boxes might need to be spaced out.
                <br><br>
                After I was satisfied, I began to recreate my sketches digitally in Figma with black/white <b>Low-Fidelity Prototype</b>

                they were to how infrequent they were to see what issues needed tackling first.
            <br><br>
            Using the affinity diagram, I then created a <b>Usability Testing Feature Prioritization Matrix</b> (pictured to the right) to break down each problem and issue based on importance.</p>

            <p>After usability testing, I went back to my old user flow and iterated on it based on my added actions and feedback. 
                The <b>Iterated User Flow</b> (pictured above) improved my understanding of the processes.
            <br><br>
            Finally, it was time to add color, utilize feedback, and apply my knowledge to the <b>Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</b> 
            (pictured below). I decided to add bits of purple as my app’s color and also to create smooth, minimal lines

                    <div class="col-sm-4"><b>Figuring out an idea:</b><br><br>
                        I originally started off with a completely different app idea but ended up pivoting after 
                        I performed my user interviews. I redid my entire assignment from the beginning all over and 
                        it was eye opening to see just how much can change with an idea even if you’re already halfway 
                        through your research.</div>
                    <div class="col-sm-4"><b>Receiving feedback:</b><br><br>
                        While performing tests on my low-fidelity prototype, I quickly realized just how valuable 
                        usability testing can be. You stare at something for so long and think you have it all figured 
                        out but you can easily fail to see obvious errors like typos or advice to add links here and 
                        there that you would’ve never thought of.</div>
                    <div class="col-sm-4"><b>Never enough time to iterate:</b><br><br>
                        I wish I had more time to iterate based on all the feedback I had received. It was 
                        reminiscent of the “real work world” with how you just sometimes don’t have enough time to get 
                        absolutely everything done. In the future I definitely want to build out the expense calculation portion of the app.</div>
